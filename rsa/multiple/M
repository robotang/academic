The RSA encryption algorithm was publically described in 1978 by three researchers at MIT. RSA was the first known algorithm suitable for signing as well as encryption. Compared other encryption schemes, RSA does not require secure transmission of decryption keys. This makes RSA suitable for several applications requiring rapid and inexpensive encryption, namely email and money transactions. It is regarded as one of the greatest advances in public key cryptography.
RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key is available to others, and is used to encrypt messages. Only the holders of the private key are able to decrypt the messages encoded by the public key.
